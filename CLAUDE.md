# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status

**This repository currently contains no code — only the spec document `PROJE.md`.** There is no `package.json`, no build/lint/test tooling, and no git history yet. `PROJE.md` is the authoritative project plan (written in Turkish); everything below is derived from it. As code is added, update this file with real build/lint/test commands.

**Critical process rule from `PROJE.md`'s final section:** do not code around anything listed under "Açık sorular" (open questions) without clarifying with the user first — don't assume, ask. As decisions are made, keep the "Kesinleşen kararlar" (finalized decisions) table and "Açık sorular" list in `PROJE.md` up to date. Work phase by phase starting from Faz 0 (see Roadmap below), and at the end of each phase show the user how to test what was built.

## What this project is

A personal automation platform that:
1. Generates 10 original mobile app ideas every morning based on real trend data.
2. Lists them in a mobile-first React UI where the user rates (1-5 stars), notes, sorts, and filters them.
3. Lets the user pick an idea, choose platform/scope, and assign a "Develop" task.
4. On "Develop", automatically runs Claude Code to scaffold that idea into a new, separate GitHub repo.
5. Integrates the process with Slack (notifications) and GitHub Issues + Projects (task tracking).

## Finalized architecture decisions

These are locked in and should not be second-guessed without discussing with the user:

- **Hosting:** Cloudflare only, free tier — no service requiring a paid plan.
- **Frontend:** React (mobile-first, PWA) on Cloudflare Pages.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express on Cloudflare Workers (`nodejs_compat` + `httpServerHandler`).
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite, free tier).
- **Repo structure:** single monorepo — frontend, backend, and workflows together.
- **Language:** TypeScript everywhere (frontend, API, scripts).
- **Claude access:** Claude Pro subscription only, via the official Claude Code GitHub Action using an OAuth token from `claude setup-token`. **No direct Anthropic API usage/credits** — this is why all Claude work (including idea generation) runs inside GitHub Actions, never from the Worker.
- **Scheduling:** daily idea generation via GitHub Actions `schedule` cron at 06:00 Türkiye time (`0 3 * * *` UTC); the Worker never runs the scheduler, only serves the API/DB.
- **Scaffolding output:** each chosen idea gets its own **private** GitHub repo on the personal account; the main repo stays **public** (so Actions minutes are unlimited, but nothing secret can live in it).
- **UI protection:** Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust free tier), restricted to the owner's email only.
- **No auto-development:** generated ideas are never developed automatically — a repo/skeleton is created only when the user explicitly clicks "Develop"; Claude Code only scaffolds, it does not continue building afterward.
- **Scaffold trigger:** submitting the task form starts skeleton generation immediately, without a separate approval step.
- **Ratings are cosmetic only:** user star ratings/notes never feed back into idea generation (only past idea *names* are used, for duplicate avoidance).
- **Notifications:** Slack free tier, single incoming webhook, sent from the Worker (not from the workflow directly).
- **Task tracking:** GitHub Issues + GitHub Projects (v2, GraphQL API), single board on the personal account; issues/board updates are made by the skeleton workflow, not the Worker.
- **No budget-limit feature** is planned in-app.
- **Idea content language:** descriptions in Turkish; the idea `name` itself is a short, memorable English app name (e.g. "MealMate").

```

### Flow 1 — Daily idea generation (automatic)

1. Cron fires at 06:00 Türkiye time. Workflow is also `workflow_dispatch`-triggerable for manual runs/catch-up. (Scheduled workflows auto-disable after 60 days with no commits — plan for a keepalive step.)
2. Workflow fetches recent idea names from the Worker API (duplicate avoidance).
3. A Node.js script collects trend data (Reddit, App Store/Google Play, Product Hunt) into a file.
4. Claude Code runs with the trend file + historical idea names, producing 10 ideas + scores in the defined JSON schema (see below).
5. Workflow validates the JSON (schema + duplicate check) and POSTs it to the Worker API.
6. Worker writes to D1 and optionally sends a Slack morning summary.

### Flow 2 — Skeleton generation (manual, per idea)

1. User picks an idea in the UI and fills out the task form.
2. Worker records the task in D1 as `queued` and triggers the skeleton workflow via `workflow_dispatch`.
3. Workflow creates a new private GitHub repo, opens an issue in it with idea + task params, adds it to the Projects board as "In progress".
4. Workflow runs Claude Code with the idea + task params, pushes the result to the new repo, comments a summary on the issue, sets board status to "Done" (or "Failed").
5. Workflow reports the result (repo URL, issue URL, status, error) back to the Worker API.
6. Worker updates the task and sends a Slack message with the repo link.

## Components (planned layout)

- **`apps/web`** — Vite + React + TypeScript, mobile-first PWA. Screens: daily idea list (grouped by date, sortable/filterable by Claude score, user score, category, status), idea detail (full description + score breakdown + user rating/note + "Develop" button), task form, tasks list (queued/running/done/failed, repo/issue links, retry). Rating an idea never triggers automation; only "Develop" + the task form starts skeleton generation. If a task already exists for an idea, "Develop" shows task status instead of allowing a second repo.
- **`apps/api`** — Express + TypeScript on Cloudflare Workers, D1 via binding. Planned endpoints: `GET /ideas`, `GET /ideas/:id`, `PATCH /ideas/:id`, `GET /ideas/recent-names`, `POST /ideas/batch` (workflow-only), `POST /tasks`, `GET /tasks`, `POST /tasks/:id/retry`, `POST /tasks/:id/result` (workflow-only). Workflow-called endpoints are protected by a shared secret. Free-tier limits (100k requests/day, 10ms CPU/call) mean the Worker must stay thin — just DB read/write and triggering external services.
- **`.github/workflows`** — `daily-ideas.yml` (Flow 1), `build-skeleton.yml` (Flow 2, `workflow_dispatch`), plus helper scripts under `scripts/` (trend collection, JSON validation, API submission — Node.js + TypeScript) and instruction templates under `prompts/` used by the Claude Code GitHub Action.

### Idea JSON schema

`name` is English; all other text fields are Turkish:

```json
{
  "name": "MealMate",
  "one_liner": "Buzdolabındaki malzemelerden haftalık yemek planı çıkaran asistan",
  "problem": "string (Turkish)",
  "target_audience": "string (Turkish)",
  "core_features": ["string (Turkish)"],
  "monetization": "string (Turkish)",
  "category": "string",
  "inspiration_source": "string (url)",
  "scores": { "market": 1, "feasibility_solo_dev": 1, "originality": 1, "overall": 1 }
}
```

### Task form fields

Platform (iOS/Swift, Android/Kotlin, cross-platform React Native/Expo or Flutter), backend need (none/Supabase/Firebase/custom API), auth (none/email/social), MVP feature selection (3-5 suggested) + free-text additions, design preference (light/dark, minimal/colorful), free-text notes.

### Skeleton repo expectations

Private repo, name derived from the idea's English name (e.g. `mealmate-app`, suffixed on collision). Must contain a working project structure, navigation, sample MVP screens, a README (idea summary, setup, architecture), basic lint/format config, and the full idea JSON saved as `IDEA.md` in the new repo.

## Data model (D1, draft)

- **ideas**: id, created_at, batch_date, name, one_liner, problem, target_audience, core_features (json), monetization, category, inspiration_source, scores (json), user_rating (1-5, nullable), user_note, status (new / archived / in_development / developed)
- **tasks**: id, idea_id, created_at, updated_at, params (json), status (queued / running / done / failed), repo_url, issue_url, project_item_id, workflow_run_id, error
- **trend_snapshots**: id, fetched_at, source, payload (json)

Note: `PROJE.md` currently lives at the repo root, not under `docs/` — move it as part of Faz 0 if adopting this structure.

## Security constraints

- UI and API must sit behind Cloudflare Access; only the owner's email can log in.
- GitHub Actions → API calls pass Cloudflare Access via a service token, plus an app-level shared-secret check.
- Because the main repo is public:
  - No secrets, internal config beyond the API address, or personal data may be committed.
  - Workflow logs and Claude Code output must never contain secrets/tokens.
  - No `pull_request_target` usage (fork PRs must not reach secrets).
  - `workflow_dispatch` must only be triggerable by users with write access.
- Secrets live only in Cloudflare secrets / GitHub Actions secrets, never in the frontend or repo: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, a fine-grained PAT scoped to private-repo creation + content write + issues write + Projects write, the workflow↔Worker shared secret, the Cloudflare Access service token, and the Slack webhook URL.

## Roadmap (phases)

1. **Faz 0 — Setup:** monorepo skeleton, Cloudflare Pages + Worker + D1 wiring, GitHub secrets, Claude Code token.
2. **Faz 1 — Idea pipeline:** D1 schema, API endpoints, trend-collection scripts, `daily-ideas.yml`.
3. **Faz 2 — UI:** access protection, idea list, detail screen, rate/archive.
4. **Faz 3 — Task & skeleton:** task form, `build-skeleton.yml`, repo/issue creation, result callback, retry.
5. **Faz 4 — Integrations:** Slack notifications, Projects board (issue creation ships in Faz 3).
6. **Faz 5 — Refinements:** better duplicate detection, new trend sources, assigning tasks from Slack, continuing development in skeleton repos via `@claude` mentions.
